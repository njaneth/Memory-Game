# Memory-Game

## Objective:
The Objective of this game is to collect the most pairs of cards in the minimal time.

## The Deck
The deck of cards has 8 pairs of cards with the images:
* Diamond
* Anchor
* Bolt
* Paper plane
* Cube
* Leaf
* Bicycle
* Bomb


## How does this works:
The game first shuffle the cards randomly and lay them face down in four rows and four columns.

## On each turn:
A single player on each turn gets to turn over any two cards.
If the two cards match, they stay open.
If they don't match, they turn back over.
On every turn the game is counting how many oportunities have you missed and removing stars from your initial score. 
The game is over when all the cards have been matched.

## The trick:
The trick is to remember which cards are where and a little bit of luck.

## The game:
The game displays a score panel with 3 stars a timer and a restart button.
The game start with 3 stars and end in 1 when the player had many missed pairs.
The Timer stops when you match all the cards.
